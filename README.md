# PokemonTeamListCreator
Creates an Open Team List/Sheet from PVPoke Team Builder paste (GO) 

# WIP

Fork of https://dhsufi.github.io/PokemonTeamListCreator/ (VGC Team Sheet generator), modified for Pokémon GO Open Team Sheets.

This website takes the "Team Sheet Export" JSON data generated from PVPoke's Team Builder section (https://pvpoke.com/team-builder/), and pre-fills a "Pokémon GO Team List" used for Show6 local GO tournaments.


## To-do:
- Instructions on how to export from PVPoke Team Builder 


## Libraries used:

- https://github.com/itsjavi/koffing - used as basis for `pvpokeparser.mjs`

- https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF


## Thanks to:
